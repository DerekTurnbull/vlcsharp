vlcsharp
========

The vlcsharp project provides a platform independent C# framework to allow an 
instance of a native [vlc](http://www.videolan.org/vlc "vlc") media player to be
embedded in a Mono/.NET application.

You get more than just simple bindings, you also get a higher level framework
that hides a lot of the complexities of working with libvlc.

The aim of this project is to port the existing [vlcj](http://caprica.github.com/vlcj "vlcj at github")
to platform independent C#, implementing as many vlcj features as possible, and 
supporting as many platforms as possible.

Since this project is, initially at least, a straight port from vlcj there may
be some inherent Java-esque traits in the implementation rather than a best-practices
C# implementation.

News
----

24/06/2012 New project.

Right now this project should be considered experimental. It is possible to create
fully working media player applications at least on Linux using C#/Mono and GTK#.

Other platforms and user interface toolkit support will be added at a later date.
